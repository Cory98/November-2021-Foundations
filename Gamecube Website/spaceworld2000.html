                    Nintendo wanted their new system to be the most powerful of the generation, (which may sound odd given their approach to console design philosophy today).
                    they would approch Silicon Graphics, their previous partner who made the graphics chip for the N64.
                    Silicon Graphics however, had internal struggles. Nintendo would need to seek out a new partner for their new system. 
                    They would partner with ArtX, a company made up of some former Silicon Graphics employees. 
                    Nintendo began development of the Gamecube as early as 1997.

                    Codenamed "Dolphin", they were hoping to release the Console by 2000, but a lack of software caused them to pushback the release to 2001. 
                    Nintendo were hoping to earn back the loyalty of third-party devs that they had lost during the N64.
                    However, the GaameCube would prove to push away third-party devs once again, for the same reasons the N64 did, Nintendo's choice in media format. 
                    the N64 still used cartridges even during the era of the DVD, compromising data space for developers. they were also more expensive to manufacturer.
                    It was assumed that Nintendo would be using a new storage format this time around. however, they did not specify what.

                    Nintendo would begin this generation like the last, with a rocky relationship with third-party devs. 
                    Nintendo could not make enough dev kits, so they would have to prioritize first-party developers.
                    This left third-party devs without a way to develop for the system. 
                    Nintendo would inform third-party devs to just develop games for the highest spec computers at the time. third-party developers were not amused.
                    Nintendo were hoping that a strong library of first-party titles would drive sales, and therefore attract third-party devs to a seemingly successful system with an established playerbase.
                    Nintendo also did not like multi-platform games, as they believed this deminished the appeal of a system if its games could be found elsewhere.
